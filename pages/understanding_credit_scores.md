# Understanding Credit Scores

A credit score is a numerical representation of your creditworthiness. It is used by lenders to evaluate the risk of lending money or offering credit to you. Credit scores typically range from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating better creditworthiness. A good credit score can unlock better interest rates on loans, credit cards, and even affect rental or employment opportunities.

## Key Factors That Affect Your Credit Score:
1. **Payment History (35%)**: Timely payments are the most significant factor. Late or missed payments negatively affect your score.
2. **Credit Utilization (30%)**: This refers to the ratio of your credit card balances to your credit limits. A low credit utilization rate (below 30%) is ideal for maintaining a good score.
3. **Length of Credit History (15%)**: The longer your credit history, the better it is for your score. This includes the age of your oldest account and the average age of all your accounts.
4. **Credit Mix (10%)**: Having a variety of credit types (credit cards, mortgages, student loans, etc.) shows lenders you can manage different forms of debt.
5. **New Credit Inquiries (10%)**: Applying for too many new credit accounts in a short time can lower your score.

## Improving Your Credit Score:
- **Make On-Time Payments**: Always pay at least the minimum amount due by the due date.
- **Reduce Credit Card Balances**: Aim to keep your credit utilization below 30%. The lower, the better.
- **Keep Accounts Open**: Closing old accounts can shorten your credit history and negatively impact your score.
- **Limit New Credit Applications**: Avoid applying for new credit unless necessary.
- **Regularly Check Your Credit Report**: Ensure accuracy and dispute any errors that may be hurting your score.

## Credit Score Ranges:
- **Excellent (750–850)**: You’ll likely receive the best interest rates and credit offers.
- **Good (700–749)**: Good credit offers and competitive rates.
- **Fair (650–699)**: You may face higher interest rates and fewer credit opportunities.
- **Poor (600–649)**: Credit may be more expensive, and approval will be harder.
- **Very Poor (300–599)**: Major difficulty in obtaining loans and credit cards.

Regularly monitoring and improving your credit score can save you significant money on interest rates and increase your financial flexibility.
