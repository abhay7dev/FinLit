# Budgeting

Budgeting is the foundation of personal financial management. It involves creating a plan for how you will spend and save your money. A budget allows you to track your income and expenses, helping you avoid debt and prioritize financial goals.

## Steps to Create a Budget:
1. **Calculate Income**: List all sources of income, including wages, freelance work, and any passive income (e.g., investments, rental income).
2. **Track Expenses**: Identify your monthly expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, and entertainment. Donâ€™t forget to include irregular or annual expenses like insurance premiums or taxes.
3. **Categorize Expenses**: Separate fixed expenses (those that remain the same each month, like rent or loan payments) from variable expenses (those that can fluctuate, like groceries and entertainment).
4. **Set Spending Limits**: Establish spending limits in each category based on your income. Be sure to allocate some of your income toward savings and investments.
5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your budget to ensure you are on track. Adjust spending or savings as necessary based on life changes or unexpected expenses.

## Budgeting Methods:
- **Zero-Based Budgeting**: Every dollar of income is assigned a purpose, leaving a $0 balance at the end of the month. This method is highly intentional and encourages full awareness of spending.
- **50/30/20 Rule**: Allocate 50% of your income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings and debt repayment.
- **Envelope System**: For cash spending, allocate a set amount to envelopes for different categories like groceries, entertainment, etc.
